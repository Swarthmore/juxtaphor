We are heavy-drinkers and whores,
What a joyless, miserable crowd!
There are flowers and birds on the walls
And the birds all grieve for a cloud.

You are smoking your old black pipe,
And the smoke looks strange over it.
The skirt that I’m wearing feels tight,
But I hope that it makes me look fit.

What’s the weather—thunder or ice?
Here, the windows are all boarded shut.
I examine your face, and your eyes
Have the look of a sly cautious cat.

Ah, what sadness I’m feeling inside!
Am I waiting for death’s solemn bell?
And that girl, who’s been dancing all night,—
She will surely end up in hell.
