	    Akhmatoviz site is a custom frontend for Juxta Web
	    Service&#8211; a set of tools for collecting texts and comparing them
	    visually. Visit
        <a href="https://github.com/performant-software/juxta-service/wiki/API-Documentation">Juxta</a>
            to learn more about our backend.

	    View the instructions above to understand how to use this website.
	    Although the instructions are pretty straightforward, there are many
	    terms that are unique to either Juxta or text collation. The rest of
	    this Help page aims to make clear what the terms mean, and what is
	    going on behind the scenes. We want to make especially clear what
	    sources, witnesses and collections are.

	    <h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
	    The first step to using this site is to add source files to your
	    workspace. Source files serve as the raw data that the user can
	    enter. After entering the sources, one can view what has been
	    uploaded by clicking on the orange button with an eye icon under
	    the sources tab. They can also be deleted by click on the trashcan
	    button. The whole point of uploading sources, however, is to
	    transform them into smarter texts that can be visualized. Checking
	    off sources and hitting transform will convert the sources into
	    witnesses.

	    <h2 id="witnesses">Witnesses</h2>
	    After transforming the sources, we have successfully used Juxta to
	    prepare the witnesses. Witnesses are versions of the original text
	    that we want to eventually compare. When a source is transformed, 
	    it gets extra metadata that allows Juxta to eventually collate
	    and visualize the different versions. Under the witnesses tab,
	    check off the witnesses you want to compare and collate them.
	    Collating groups the witnesses together into collection sets,
	    which are easily visualized.

	    <h2 id="collections" >Collections</h2>
	    Collections are sets of witnesses that can be visualized. Under
	    the collections tab, one can view all the collections that have
	    been built. Some may take a second to finsih collating. Once
	    collated, however, the collection can be visualized as either
	    a heatmap or a side-by-side comparison view.
