We’re harlots here and carousers,
How unhappy are we all!
On the walls the birds and flowers
Are homesick for the clouds.

The black pipe you are holding—
So strange the puffs of smoke.
To appear even more slender
I put on my narrow skirt.

Blocked forever are the windows.
Is there frost or a storm outside?
But the eyes of a wary house cat
Are not unlike your eyes.

Oh, how my heart is aching!
Do I wait for the hour of death?
But the woman who now dances
Will surely be in hell.
