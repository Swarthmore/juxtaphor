A custom front-end to for a Juxta Web Server

6.17

In the dev folder you'll find:

- package.json file     
    + to start playing with grunt 
- a sample gruntfile.js     
    + though you're going to have to fiddle with it to work
- a suggested folder structure     
    + dev 
        * _
            - components
                + sass
                + js
            - js
                + lib
        * css
            
On the server, you'll find the web service running and you all have access to development folders of
your own. Each of your home folders has a dev subfolder that has a symlink -- you can see what you're making on the web.
