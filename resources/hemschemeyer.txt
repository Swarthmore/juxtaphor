We are all carousers and loose women here;
How unhappy we are together!
The flowers and birds on the wall
Yearn for the clouds.

You are smoking a black pipe,
The puff of smoke has a funny shape.
I’ve put on my tight skirt
To make myself look still more svelte.

The windows are boarded up forever.
What’s out there—hoarfrost or a storm?
Your eyes resemble
The eyes of a cautious cat.

Oh, I am sick at heart!
Isn’t it the hour of death I await?
But that woman dancing now
Will be in hell, no doubt.
